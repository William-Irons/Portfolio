		<article><p>I have a lot of varied interests, which mostly fall into three main groups, gaming, sports, and social advocacy.</p>
				<p>I love playing board games, and my favorites involve strategy, bluffing, and negotiation. I also love games with strong themes. A few of my favorite board games are <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37111/battlestar-galactica"> Battlestar Galactica</a>, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola">Agricola</a>, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/35677/le-havre">Le Havre</a>, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10547/betrayal-house-hill">Betrayal at House on the Hill</a>, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31481/galaxy-trucker\">Galaxy Trucker</a>, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/96848/mage-knight-board-game">Mage Knight</a> and <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/11/bohnanza">Bohnanza</a>. I love learning new games and I find that playing games with new people is one of the best ways to learn how to work with them.</p>
				
				<p>I also am a competitve Magic the Gathering player. The things I like most is discussing the best strategies with other players so I can grow stronger, talking to others about deck building choices, and building new decks to tackle the current metagame from new perspectives.</p>
				<p>I also run a Dungeons and Dragons game for a few of my friends as the Dungeon Master. Being a Dungeon Master can be a challenging but rewarding experience as you have to balance and develop your ability to tell stories, enforce rules, mediate conflict and role play all while providing a fun experience for your players. Dungeons and Dragons is a great way to experience telling stories as a group and roleplaying as people you would never get to normally experience.</p>
				
				<p>I love sports and being outdoors. In the past I have played rugby, volleyball, badminton, American football, lacrosse, and basketball. Currently because of my very busy schedule I only have time to do some occasional hiking and running. I would love to get back into sports on organized leagues more specifically I intend to play rugby and volleyball in the future. I love the comradderie, feeling of accomplishment, and working as a team that sports provides, while also providing a great way to keep in shape.</p>
				
				<p> Advocacy has been a big part of how I spent my free time in the past as I have volunteered for queer and feminist organizations in the pase in advocation, education, and support roles.</p>
